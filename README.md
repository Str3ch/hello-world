A puppet's not yet human, or is it no more?
I want to live like in an Indian movie score:
I feel, I live; the Golden Age is long gone
In Amazon's virgin woods, I'm a poacher, all wrong
"No exit from postmodern" - a toilet wall decree
Whoever gets the flow is the man, you'll see
Any puppet will become human, no matter the fee
No turning back, and I'll hit you with a bottle, you'll be
Because words are powerless to express my love's degree
Only ISIS fighters know its absolute, you'll see
But not you, pigs, stuffed with crap, can't comprehend, it seems
A human's what the internet shits (Here it comes)
I hate violence, but you're even worse, it's true
And time is a deadly weapon, don't you know?
I just observe: a young guy, didn't even turn around, and they're carrying him out in a coffin (Ha-ha, the earth is a tomb)
Well, let's remember that damn puppet, then.
